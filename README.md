#&nbsp;![alt tag](http://dotnetify.net/content/images/greendot.png) dotNetify App Template


This is a work in progress...but the goal of this project is to provide a dotNetify-powered application template for sustainable web/mobile application projects, that is, those projects that will have longer life-span and therefore has emphasis on quality attributes such as maintainability, extensibility, and reliability.  Its architecture is typically identified by having high cohesion and low coupling among its components.

The design strategy being used here are:
- Onion architecture, which reduces coupling between components through dependency injection.
- SOLID abstractions that enforce clear separation of concerns.
- Service/repository pattern at data access layer.
- MVVM pattern with view models at the back-end.
- Knockout web components to increase front-end reusability and readability.

The application featured in this template is a single-page-application for ordering food delivery.
