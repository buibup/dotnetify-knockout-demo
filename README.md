#&nbsp;![alt tag](http://dotnetify.net/content/images/greendot.png) dotNetify - web & mobile hybrid app template
Coupled with Apache Cordova, dotNetify enables rapid development of SignalR-powered web and mobile hybrid applications that are incredibly lightweight on the front-end, and running on a cross-platform .NET back-end.

TO run this, you will need [Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, .NET Core Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2015), and [WebPack Task Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebPackTaskRunner).

##Highlights

* No need for complicated client-side framework to manage your front-end - it's just that simple.
* No need for ASP.NET API controllers nor client-side AJAX - data is auto-delivered right from/to C# view models.
* Built-in bi-directional real-time communication on top of WebSocket technology, courtesy of SignalR.
* Built-in offline support for mobile apps - state of visited pages can be cached and used when disconnected.
* Close to 100% code-reuse between hosted web app and hybrid mobile app.
* Use modern tooling: ASP.NET Core, Typescript, NPM, WebPack.
