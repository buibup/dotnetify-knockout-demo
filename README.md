#&nbsp;![alt tag](http://dotnetify.net/content/images/greendot.png) dotNetify - web & mobile hybrid app template

Combined with Apache Cordova, dotNetify enables rapid development of SignalR-powered web and mobile hybrid applications that are incredibly lightweight on the front-end, and running on a cross-platform .NET back-end.

##Highlights

* No need for complicated JS client-side framework to manage your front-end - it's just that simple.
* No fat controllers nor REST APIs to write - your data is auto-delivered right into your C# view models.
* Out-of-the-box bi-directional real-time communication on top of WebSocket technology, courtesy of SignalR.
* Built-in offline support for mobile apps - state of visited pages can be cached and used when disconnected.
* Exact-same codebase for the most part between hosted web app and hybrid mobile app.
