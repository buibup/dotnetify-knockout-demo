Coupled with Apache Cordova, [dotNetify](http://dotnetify.net) enables rapid development of SignalR-powered web and mobile hybrid applications that are incredibly lightweight on the front-end, and running on a cross-platform .NET Core back-end.

TO run this, you will need [Visual Studio 2015 Update 3, .NET Core Tools](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windowsvs2015), and [WebPack Task Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MadsKristensen.WebPackTaskRunner).

##Highlights

* No complicated client-side framework to manage your front-end - it's just that simple.
* No ASP.NET API controllers, no client-side AJAX - data is auto-delivered right from/to C# view models.
* Built-in bi-directional real-time communication on top of WebSocket technology, courtesy of SignalR.
* Built-in offline support for mobile apps - states of visited pages can be cached and used when disconnected.
* Close to 100% code-reuse between hosted web app and hybrid mobile app.
* Web components for client-side modularity and reusability.
* DDD and SOLID principles on the back-end for maintainability and extensibility.
* Use modern tooling: ASP.NET Core, [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/), [WebPack](https://webpack.github.io/).
